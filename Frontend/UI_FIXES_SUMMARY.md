# UI Fixes Summary - Luxe Fashion Boutique

## Overview
This document summarizes all the UI fixes and improvements made to ensure consistent Bootstrap usage throughout the application and fix image sizing issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mixed CSS Framework Usage
**Problem**: The application was using both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS classes inconsistently, causing styling conflicts and poor UI consistency.

**Solution**: 
- Converted all Tailwind classes to Bootstrap equivalents
- Maintained Bootstrap as the primary CSS framework
- Updated global CSS to use Bootstrap variables and utilities

### 2. Form Field Alignment Issues
**Problem**: Login and Register forms had inconsistent field sizing and alignment, particularly the email field appearing "off" compared to other fields.

**Solution**:
- Standardized all form controls to use `form-control form-control-lg` classes
- Applied consistent padding and border radius
- Used Bootstrap's grid system for proper alignment
- Added proper validation styling with Bootstrap's `is-invalid` class

### 3. Product Image Sizing Problems
**Problem**: Product images were displaying with inconsistent sizes and aspect ratios, causing layout issues.

**Solution**:
- Fixed image containers to use consistent height (280px for desktop, responsive for mobile)
- Applied `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: center` for proper image scaling
- Used Bootstrap's responsive utilities for different screen sizes
- Added proper aspect ratio containers

### 4. Inconsistent Button Styling
**Problem**: Buttons had mixed styling approaches and inconsistent hover effects.

**Solution**:
- Standardized all buttons to use Bootstrap button classes
- Applied custom gradient styling for primary buttons
- Added consistent hover effects with transform and shadow
- Used Bootstrap Icons for all icon elements
